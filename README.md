## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed with my own personal style and training style in mind. Clean, to the point and focussed on what I want to achieve. Focus was put on images of people enjoying themselves and working hard, both in private and group classes. 

### Colour
For the colour scheme cool and vibrant colors were chosen to reflect the calmness and simplicity of my own character and the services I offer, as well as being energetic and inspiring movement and vibrance. 
<br>

![Colour scheme](assets/images/color-palette.png)


### Fonts
Roboto was used for the logo and the headings throughout the site. The logic behind this was to maintain style and simplicity throughout the site and call attention to key information.
<br>
Source-sans-pro was chosen for the body text of the website, this font combines very well with Roboto and again maintains the clean simplistic approach site-wide. 

### Structure
The page is structured in a well know, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the restaurant logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right. 
The website consists of five separate pages: 
- A homepage with a brief introduction to the services offered, a call to action as well as a short description of "how it works".
- An about page with information about me, my credentials, background, hobbies and interests to give the user an opportunity to get to know me. 
- A group training page, with a call to action, group class times and locations, and some information on the types of training offered. 
- A private training page, with a call to action, 2 options and a breakdown of the different servcies offered. 
- A contact page with a text input area to allow customers to get in contact regarding anything they would like to know or say.
