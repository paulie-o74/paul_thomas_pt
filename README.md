## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed with my own personal style and training style in mind. Clean, to the point and focussed on what I want to achieve. Focus was put on images of people enjoying themselves and working hard, both in private and group classes. 

### Colour
For the colour scheme cool and vibrant colors were chosen to reflect the calmness and simplicity of my own character and the services I offer, as well as being energetic and inspiring movement and vibrance. 
<br>

![Colour scheme](assets/images/color-palette.png)


### Fonts
Roboto was used for the logo and the headings throughout the site. The logic behind this was to maintain style and simplicity throughout the site and call attention to key information.
<br>
Source-sans-pro was chosen for the body text of the website, this font combines very well with Roboto and again maintains the clean simplistic approach site-wide. 

### Structure
The page is structured in a well known, recognizable, user-friendly, and easy to learn manner. Upon arriving at the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the business' logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right. 
The website consists of five separate pages: 
- A homepage with a brief introduction to the services offered, a call to action as well as a short description of "how it works".
- An about page with information about me, my credentials, background, hobbies and interests to give the user an opportunity to get to know me. 
- A group training page, with a call to action, group class times and locations, and some information on the types of training offered. 
- A private training page, with a call to action, 2 options and a breakdown of the different services offered. 
- A contact page with a text input area to allow customers to get in contact regarding anything they would like to know or say. 

### Wireframes

Shown below are the initial wireframes which changed throughout the development process. Reasons include: increasing subject knowledge of UX design and CSS options, removal of bootstrap elements, the need for a cleaner more streamlined design.

![About](/assets/images/about-validated.png)
![Group-Training](/assets/images/group-validated.png)
![Private-Training](/assets/images/private-training.png)
![Contact](/assets/images/contact-validated.png)

### CSS Validation
The W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service was used to validate the CSS of the website.
When validating the page as a whole, the validator shows some errors linked to Bootstrap v5.0. When validating just my own custom CSS it passes with no errors found and some warnings associated to using root variables.
![CSS](/assets/images/css-validation.png)

### Accessibility
The WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool was used to ensure the website met high accessibility standards. All pages pass with 1 errors. This error is due to a label which must be included for the toggle menu (burger menu) to work functionally only using CSS (no bootstrap).
