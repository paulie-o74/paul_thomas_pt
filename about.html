              <h2>My message</h2><br>
          <p>
              After 20+ years of being active (but not neccessarily always healthy) I feel like I have developed a deep understanding of the key barriers to an active healthy lifestyle as well
              as some of the major motivators to help people make a change. <br> My goal is to help people realise their potential, and to do so I think it's important that people understand that we all start from different places. 
              <br> All it takes is making a decision and reaching out for help to get started.

              <h2>My Training philosophy</h2><br>
              <p>My idea of training is "We were built to do this, we were designed to move and there are only positive effects from being active". 
                  Unfortunately, the rhythm, distraction, obligations, and stress of modern life present lots of obstacles for people being active. 
                  <br> My speciality is helping people see the worth and importance in being active and helping them to realise their potential.

          <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3><br>
          <ul>
              <li>As expected- almost all types of physical movement. Specifically I love basketball, football, yoga, weight training, tennis, padel, surf, snowboarding, skateboarding (which I just took up aged 35!)</li>
              <li>Music- I love listening to music at all times and love to have a soundtrack for any and all activities. Anyone who knows me knows my favourites are funk and disco. </li>
              <li>Listening to podcasts- I love to zone out to all types of sports podcasts, history, things you should know, current affairs, whatever! </li>
              <li>Documentaries - I love sitting down at the end of a long day to some David Attenborough or Brian Cox.</li>
              <li>Travelling- Whenever we have the chance my fiance and I love to get away and explore the Spanish country and beyond- we are blessed to live in such a fantastic continent with so much rich history everywhere. </li>

              <p>
                I really enjoy my sessions with Paul, he's calm, cool and collected and listens to what I want from a personal training experience. He's really encouraging and doesn't make you feel bad at the start of your journey, he recognises that we all start from different starting points and helped me a lot in sticking to my routine.

                Joining the group classes with Paul were the best decision I made when I first arrived in Madrid. It allowed me to meet a fun international group, make friends, practice my awful spanish in a fun active environment and all the while receiving top class coaching from one of the best personal traininers in the city. 100% reccommended.
