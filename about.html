        <h3>What my clients say:</h3>
        <p>
            I really enjoy my sessions with Paul, he's calm, cool and collected and listens to what I want from a personal training experience. He's really encouraging and doesn't make you feel bad at the start of your journey, he recognises that we all start from different starting points and helped me a lot in sticking to my routine.

            Joining the group classes with Paul were the best decision I made when I first arrived in Madrid. It allowed me to meet a fun international group, make friends, practice my awful spanish in a fun active environment and all the while receiving top class coaching from one of the best personal traininers in the city. 100% reccommended.

            I started the remote training with Paul during the first lockdown and I must say looking forward to our online sessions were one of the things that kept me sane during that time! Paul would meet with me online twice a week, once for a home training session and once for a summary of how the week went, analysing activity and diet and having him as a support during such a difficult time allowed me to stay positive, active and upbeat.

        <h3>My Training philosophy</h3>
        <p>My idea of training is "We were built to do this, we were designed to move and there are only positive effects from being active". 
            Unfortunately, the rhythm, distraction, obligations, and stress of modern life present lots of obstacles for people being active. 
            My speciality is helping people see the worth and importance in being active and helping them to realise their potential. 
            Unlocking this potenital can affect all aspects of their lives, giving a renewed sense of self worth, contributing to their mental and physical well-being, 
            through practicing resilience, planning and achieving goals and objectives and being social while doing so. I believe that true growth comes from the difficult moments in life and when we start to embrace these tough moments,
            when we struggle, when we try and try again, we become stronger both physically and mentally from it. Being the best you can be requires a lifetime of practice, 
            commitment to yourself and others and many failures along the way, but it's through this process that many of us see our true identities.
