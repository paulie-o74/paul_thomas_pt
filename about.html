        <h3>My Message</h3><br>
        <p>
          After 20+ years of being active (but not neccessarily always healthy) I feel like I have developed a deep
          understanding of the key barriers to an active healthy lifestyle as well
          as some of the major motivators to help people make a change. <br> My goal is to help people realise their
          potential, and to do so I think it's important that people understand that we all start from different places.
          <br> All it takes is making a decision and reaching out for help to get started.

        <h3>My Training philosophy</h3><br>
        <p>My idea of training is "We were built to do this, we were designed to move and there are only positive
          effects from being active".
          Unfortunately, the rhythm, distraction, obligations, and stress of modern life present lots of obstacles for
          people being active.
          <br> My speciality is helping people see the worth and importance in being active and helping them to realise
          their potential.

      <h2>What my clients say</h2><br>
      <p>
        I really enjoy my sessions with Paul, he's calm, cool and collected and listens to what I want from a personal
        training experience. He's really encouraging and doesn't make you feel bad at the start of your journey, he
        recognises that we all start from different starting points and helped me a lot in sticking to my routine.

        Joining the group classes with Paul were the best decision I made when I first arrived in Madrid. It allowed me
        to meet a fun international group, make friends, practice my awful spanish in a fun active environment and all
        the while receiving top class coaching from one of the best personal traininers in the city. 100% reccommended.
